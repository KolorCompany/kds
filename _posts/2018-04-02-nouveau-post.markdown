At Kolor, we want to create harmonious experiences for our users. We solve challenging interactions at the outset, and then apply the solutions consistently across our product suite - making sure people only have to learn them once.!

Our guidelines have space for flexibility, and are continuously revised and expanded to suit changing product needs.
